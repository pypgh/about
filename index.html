<p>This is Philip Kwan, also known as Pypgh (pÉªp).<br>I am a recent graduate among UCLA's electrical engineering class of 2016! <br> I am currently seeking opportunities
within the California area. <br> My primary focuses are RF, ICs, and signal processing. <br> I am studying for the GRE as I hope to one
day further my studies in graduate school. <br>I am also expanding my interests through Coursera at this time.</p>


<p>On the side, I enjoy: </p> 
<ul>
<li> Volunteering &ndash; I like to help people if it makes life just a bit easier.</li>
<li> Italian &ndash; I have a Twitter account just for it. I want to go to Italy someday! </li> 
<li> Theatrical acting &ndash; I have some basic experience from UCLA.</li>
<li> Basketball &ndash; Organized an IM team in spring, participating in wheelchair basketball this summer.</li>
<li> Kickball &ndash; I'm part of a team in a league! </li> 
<li> Rock climbing &ndash; Occasionally; still getting used to it. </li> 
<li> Skateboarding/cruising &ndash; I need some speed to make up for not having a car! </li>
<li> Photography &ndash; I'm a beginner. The background photo is by yours truly!</li>
<li> Discovering new music through Spotify &ndash; Discover Weekly works wonders! </li>
<li> Concerts &ndash; Los Angeles is one of the best scenes for indie music!  </li>
<li> Food! Nearly everything with meat is great!</li>
